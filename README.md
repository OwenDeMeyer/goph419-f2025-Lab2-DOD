For this lab, codes for an iterative gauss-seidel/jacobi solver functions were implemented and tested in python (tested using PyTest) with direct comparisons to proven methods in NumPy. After, spline interpolation functions of orders 1, 2, and 3 were created and tested in python as well, and these functions were tested using SciPy’s UnivariateSpline for direct comparisons. Then these functions were applied to two scenarios with differing density and temperature values, which were promptly plotted and displayed using Matplotlib. The functions used linear, quadratic, and cubic spline interpolations to do this (order of 1, 2, and 3). There are directions to run the driver files and the test files (both as one unit in tests.py, and individual tests in the tests folder) in the respective files.
